Bootstrap Tutorial
------------------
Note: I downloaded jQuery for this and put it into the /js/ folder
(version 1.11.1).
(It does not come with Bootstrap.)
Original Bootstrap distribution is in the folder named /dist BOOTSTRAP/

GRIDS and CONTAINER

The beginning of the tutorial is about using the grid system of Bootstrap.
It is a a 12-column grid.
You can use mixed column widths on a page.
Each column is spec'd within a row.
.container - A DIV with this class must wrap the rows.
Can use more than one .container DIV on a page.
Can use more than one .row DIV in any container.

.container adds responsive margins left and right.

You make cols inside rows like so:
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-2">
</div>
</div>

In fact, that example would require more columns, because col-lg-2 means
the DIV (block) spans 2 columns. Six like that would make 6 perfectly spaced
columns across the full available 12 columns.

RESPONSIVE

To control the responsive reactions, the column specs would usually be
more like this:
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-2">
That says: On small screens, the DIV spans 6 columns (total = 2/row);
On medium screens, the DIV spans 4 columns (total = 3/row);
On large screens, the DIV spans 2 columns (total = 6/row).

My file named responsive_layout.html shows that layout.
That file also includes clearfix DIVs, which are used to ensure that
the tops of columns line up neatly from left to right. Clearfixes must
specify inline, block, or inline-block:
<div class="clearfix visible-sm-block"></div>
They are positioned at the breakpoint for the row, for each device size.
Note: If you will have exactly six blocks, in the case above you
will not need a clearfix for the large screen.

Also, if you set options for ONLY small screens, it cascades up --
all bigger screens will follow suit.

TEXT STYLES

Working with Paragraphs: Bootstrap's global default font-size is 14px,
with a line-height of 1.428. This is applied to the <body> and all paragraphs.
In addition to that a bottom margin of half their line-height (10px by default)
is applied to the all paragraphs (<p>).
You can also make a paragraph stand out by just adding the class .lead.

TABLES

Just add Bootstrap's .table class to the <table> element.

LISTS

UL classes:
Add class="list-unstyled" to UL to remove bullets.
Add class="list-inline" to UL to position all list items inline.

Bootstrap list groups:
Easy menu construction with UL class="list-group"

Horizontal definition lists:
Position definition-list items left and right with .dl-horizontal.

FORMS

No class needed on <form>.

http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.2.0/docs/css/#forms

"Note:In Bootstrap 3 all textual elements like <input>, <textarea>, and <select>
with the class .form-control are 100% wide by default. To use them inline,
you'll have to set a width on the element the form controls used within."

"Note:It is recommended to include a label for every form inputs otherwise
screen readers will have trouble with your forms. However in case of inline form
layout you can hide these labels using the .sr-only class."

"You can also match the sizes of your form controls to the Bootstrap grid column
sizes. Just wrap your form controls (i.e. <input>, <textarea>, and <select>) in
grid columns, or any custom element and apply the grid classes on it."

There are lots of options for forms!

http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-forms.php

"Bootstrap includes support for all standard form controls as well as new HTML5
input types such as datetime, number, email, url, search, tel, color etc. The
following example will show you the usages of standard form controls with
Twitter Bootstrap."

IMAGES

Various options:
http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-images.php

"Images in Bootstrap 3 can be made responsive-friendly via the addition of the
.img-responsive class. This applies max-width: 100%; and height: auto; to the
image so that it scales nicely to the parent element."

Example:
<img src="..." class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">

http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.2.0/docs/css/#images

ICONS

"Bootstrap includes 200 Glyphicons" (I see 64), available in font format for
usability and scalability. You can apply the CSS color property on the specific
element.

NAV: TABS and PILLS (BUTTONS)

Default styles available for horizontal tabs and both horizontal and vertical
buttons (called pills).

MOVING FORWARD
--------------

At this point, I felt ready to leave the tutorial and attempt to use Bootstrap
to revise an existing website.

Step 1:
-------
http://getbootstrap.com/customize/

That led me to:
http://getbootstrap.com/css/

Having worked through the first 14 pages in the Tutorial Republic site
(http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/),
I understood what I was seeing on that page, which previously had made
me feel a bit hopeless about learning Bootstrap.

Most important, I understood the grid, columns, and breakpoints. I got
that from the tutorial.

FONTS and FONT SIZE
I wanted to change the defaults. Looking at:
http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type

"Built with Less
"The typographic scale is based on two Less variables in variables.less:
@font-size-base and @line-height-base. The first is the base font-size used
throughout and the second is the base line-height. We use those variables and
some simple math to create the margins, paddings, and line-heights of all our
type and more. Customize them and Bootstrap adapts."

I discover I can change font-family here:
http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#typography

Also there, in the field labeled @font-size-base, I can change the
base font-size.

BODY and other COLORS
These are here:
http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#scaffolding

Step 2:
-------
Copy the website I want to revise and add the default Bootstrap files
and folders to the site folder.
Starting with one page only, strip out all link rel="stylesheet" tags
that point to my own stylesheet. Leave all DIVs as they are (without the
stylesheets, they will act as generic DIVs).
Add all Bootstrap link and script tags as per my template.

Success! Your configuration has been saved to https://gist.github.com/f43de3388e4a8cbe3c7b and can be revisited here at http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=f43de3388e4a8cbe3c7b for further customization.
