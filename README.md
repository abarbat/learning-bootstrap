learning-bootstrap
==================

To learn to use the Bootstrap framework, I am using this site:

http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/

It's similar in many ways to the official Bootstrap documentation, which can be found here:

http://bootstrapdocs.com/

However, the tutorial was more useful to me for getting started. This page in particular:

http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-get-started.php

I also learned from this free online course:

https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV203x+2015_T2/info

Note that although the trainer is heavily dependent on MS Visual Studio and a library of Bootstrap snippets, you don't need ANY of that, and the code in the snippets is all available for copying at the Bootstrap site. However, I did get a lot out of the guy's walkthroughs.

If you want to learn Bootstrap, make sure you get your files from:
